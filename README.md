# Optoro's Next Steps with Vue.js

## About

Vue.js has helped Optoro expand its product offering by enabling rapid development and release cycles. From single-component login forms to brand new ground-up products, they've shipped a lot of new Vue code since they adopted it a couple years ago. Andrew gives you a peek behind the curtains and talk about how Optoro transitioned away from Angular.js and explore the changes they made during the process of upgrading their tooling to support Vue.js apps.
